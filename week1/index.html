        <h4>Doing Stuff With Web Things: Local Storage(Section 3)</h4>
        <p>How to get, store, and display user data.</p>
        <p>Use inputs (input, textarea) to <strong>get</strong> user data.</p>
        <p>Save input data to a variable using ".value" to get data from the input and "localStorage.setItem" to <strong>store</strong> the data.
        <p>Local storage uses key-value pairs(In the code example, "storyName" becomes the key and "storyHTML" becomes the value).</p>
        <p>Use "localStorage.getItem" to retrieve a saved story. It searches for the key (storyName) and saves its value (storyHTML) to a variable. You then insert the value into the text area for the user to resume editing.</p>
        <p>To <strong>display</strong> the story, take the value of the text area and insert it into the "display" section.</p>

        <h4>Master Mobile UX</h4>
        <p>Develop mobile first and work your way up to desktop.</p>
        <p>Focus on important content when they first open the page to keep users' attention. Don't make users hunt for the content and functionality of the app.</p>
        <p>Improve user experience by being there to help with issues, having a clear purpose for your app, and reducing steps to make sure the process requires as few moves as possible. Automate as much as possible.</p>
        <p>Think about reachability for mobile devices and tablets. Make sure key items are in easy-to-reach places.</p>
        <p>Reduce speed wherever possible: reduce image usage, use SVG/Webfonts, optimize and minify CSS and JS, and GZIP(compress) files(eliminates unecessary data).</p>
        <p>Mobile input - tips to make forms user friendly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Put labels <strong>inside</strong> of the input field and float the label to the top of the field when data is entered.</li>
          <li>Use as few fields as possible by offering checkbox options and only showing the fields that are needed.</li>
          <li>If you must use many fields, section it out, but include and indicator to tell users how many more pages of input are needed.</li>
          <li>Autocomplete!</li>
          <li>When dealing with passwords, show the password by default and give the option to hide it.</li>
          <li>When dealing with credit card entry, use auto-space and auto-advance for easy entry.</li>
          <li>Present appropriate keyboards and include link for phone numbers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When advertising, do NOT use pop-ups! MAke ads unobstrusive and think about whether you would be irritated by the ad.</p>
        <p>Keep ads small and simple - don't take up too much space and don't put them too high on the page.</p>
        <p>Tips for user-friendly ads:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Small ads that expand on click.</li>
          <li>Use ad as the background where content scrolls over the ad, offering small views of the ad here and there.</li>
          <li>Include a small sticky ad at the bottom that expands on click.</li>
        </ul>
