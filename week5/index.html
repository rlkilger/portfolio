      <h3>Week 5 Notes</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Javascript: Novice to Ninja Ch. 10 - Testing and Debugging</h4>
        <p>Exception - an error that when raised, produces a return value that can be used by the program to handle the error</p>
        <p>Calling a function that does not exist raises a reference error</p>
        <p>Stack trace - functions or methods that lead to the point of the error</p>
        <p>Warning - error that doesn't cause code to crash</p>
        <p>Strict mode - throws errors for things that can be seen as "poor style" - "use strict;"</p>
        <p>Strict mode can also be applied inside of a function for use in only that function. That way, if you are working with other developers that aren't using strict mode, it won't throw errors for their code.</p>
        <p>Linting enforces a style guide - JS Lint, JS Hint, and ES Lint are used to highlight sloppy programming practices and syntax errors</p>
        <p>Determine browser support for a feature using feature detection by using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to call the method</p>
        <p>Calling an method for an object that does not exist would throw an error, an if statement would return false and not execute</p>
        <p>console.trace() method will log an interactive stack trace in the console</p>
        <p>Other console methods - <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/three-little-known-development-console-api-methods/">http://www.sitepoint.com/three-little-known-development-console-api-methods/</a></p>
        <p>debugger - acts as a breakpoint when written into code</p>
        <p>Error object can be created using constructor function with error message as parameter - const error = new Error('Oops, something went wrong');</p>
        <p>Error objects used for specific errors:</p>
        <p>RangeError - number is outside an allowable range</p>
        <p>ReferenceError - reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist, like calling a function that hasn't been defined</p>
        <p>SyntaxError - error in the code’s syntax</p>
        <p>TypeError - error in the type of value used, like if a string is used when a number is expected</p>
        <p>Error objects can also be used to create custom error objects - const error = new TypeError('You need to use numbers in this function');</p>
        <p>You then "throw" the error object when an error occurs - throw new Error('Something has gone badly wrong!');</p>
        <p>Try block - runs the code inside the block, if an exception occurs it will pass the error object that is thrown onto a catch block. The code inside the catch block will only run if an exception is thrown inside the try block</p>
        <p>The error object is passed as a parameter to the catch block</p>
        <p>finally block can be added after a catch block and will be executed after the try or catch block, whether an exception occurred or not</p>
